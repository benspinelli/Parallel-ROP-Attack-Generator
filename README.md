# Parallel-ROP-Attack-Generator
15-418 final project writeup backup. Original at http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/christi3/418/finalproject.html

This is a backup of the writeup and presentation slides for PROPAGANDA, a parallel ROP attack generator that was a final project and competition finalist for the Spring semester of 15-418. Link to the original writup location is above. The code itself are not hosted publicly at the request of Professor Bryant, as they would trivialize 15-213's Attack Lab (which was indeed the origin of this project idea).
